# UNP_PROJECT_CROP_YIELD_ANALYSIS

Developed an AI & ML powered predictive model to optimize crop yield and encourage sustainable agriculture. Leveraged a historical crop yield dataset (19,689 rows, 10 features) from Kaggle, performing extensive data cleaning, encoding, and preprocessing using Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. Cultivated a Random Forest Regressor trained on normalized data (80/20 split), ultimately. achieving an exceptional R² score of 0.9868 and MSE of 9675.42, indicating an almost perfect predictive clarity and accuracy.

Depicted a visual Actual vs Predicted Yield to confirm model reliability, and analyzed Feature Importance—identifying Crop Type, State, and Area as the dominant predictors of productivity. Proposed scalable, ethical AI deployment frameworks, including Community Agri-Tech Hubs and Public Data Accessibility Policies, to ensure affordability for small-scale farmers.

The project culminated in a live presentation and technical report, earning a great evaluation for innovation, clarity, and data-driven problem solving. All code was implemented in Google Colab (Python) with structured documentation, visualizations, and reproducible pipelines for future research and extension.
